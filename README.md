This project was created by the student Danielfarid Fearn Holden, Student ID: 22047880

It aims to replicate from scratch, the chemical colour mixing game shown via: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/ZQ-AiFv9dH0

Thus with that, any resources used and other material made will be referenced in the final report document, as well as throughout the code.

Thanks :D
